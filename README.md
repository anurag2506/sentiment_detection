<h1> Sentiment-Detection using NLP</h1>
<h3>Libraries Used:</h3>
<p>1. Newspaper<br>2.Textblob<br>3.NLTK<br>4.cv2,<br>5.matplotlib</p>
<h3>Brief Idea of the project</h3>
<p>This project aims at determining the setiment of a particular text-file or wikipedia-page or any other source of text<br>
This is done by converting the whole text into a summary which will capture the general notion of the text and return it 
<br> We do this using the article function from the newspaper library<br> After converting the summary into a blob using the TextBlob function we find the sentiment polarity which is a floating point value between -1 and 1, where -1 represents extreme sorrow and 1 represnts unconditional joy and 0 is neutral <br><br></p>
<p> And based on the sentiment floating value I ouput the path for a particular emotion and using cv2 and maptlotlib I display the emoji</p>
<br> <p> This project gives a good understanding of the way texts can be summarised and how the sentiment of the text can be detected </p>
